d.  
Binomial distribution can be approximately a normal distribution with npq variance and np mean  
np=120*0.1  
npq=120*0.1*0.9

### a
Queuing delay of the ith packet:

### b
![P13_4](https://github.com/xjywhu/WLFBSHomeWork2/blob/master/P13_4.PNG) is required to transmit n packets. Therefore, when n packets per batch arrive, the buffer is empty. 
Therefore, the average delay of a group among all batches is the average delay within a batch, that is:
